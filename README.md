# Weather App 🌧️🌧️💙💙


#### Simple and Beautiful Weather App using Java.

I am using **https://openweathermap.org/** to get all the data using JSON file.

### Steps :

> First, you have to create a account on it.

> Then, generate a a unique API key to get all the data from the JSON file.

> Paste you **API KEY** in **_LocationCord.java_** file as

```
public final static String API_KEY = "81a26c8f0de407b94623e9f43e825679";
```

#### API key calling from this website : **https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3**

#### The One Call API provides the following weather data for any geographical coordinates:

- Current weather
- Minute forecast for 1 hour
- Hourly forecast for 48 hours
- Daily forecast for 8 days
- National weather alerts
- Historical weather data for 40+ years back (since January 1, 1979)
